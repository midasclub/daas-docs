# Bots

## The Bot object

An object representing a Steam Bot. DaaS uses bots to host lobbies. For a
production environment, in order to ensure you never, or very rarely run out of
bots, you should have three times as much bots as simultaneous lobbies that you
expect to host (i.e: if you expect to host up to 10 lobbies at once, you
should have a minimum of 30 Steam Bots).

> Example object:

```json
<%= json example_bot %>
```

Property | Type | Description
-------- | ---- | -----------
id | number | The unique identifier of the bot.
username | string | The username of the Steam account of the bot.
password | string | The password of the Steam account of the bot. DaaS needs it to authenticate as your bot.
steamGuardEnabled | boolean | Whether or not the bot has Steam Guard enabled.
status | [BotStatus](#botstatus) | The current status of the bot.
disabledUntil | number? | If the bot is disabled, the date until it will remain so, in UNIX Timestamp format. Otherwise, null.

## Get all Bots

```shell
<%= curl({ :endpoint => "/bots" }) %>
```

```javascript
const bots = await daas.Bots.getAll()
```

> <%= http 200 %>

```json
<%= json [example_bot] %>
```

Retrieves all bots.

### HTTP Request

`<%= get "/bots" %>`

## Get a single Bot

```shell
<%= curl({ :endpoint => "/bots/:id" }) %>
```

```javascript
const bot = await daas.Bots.get(id)
```

> <%= http 200 %>

```json
<%= json example_bot %>
```

Retrieves a specific bot

### HTTP Request

`<%= get "/bots/:id" %>`

### URL Parameters

Parameter | Description
--------- | -----------
id | The ID of the Bot.

## Create a Bot

```shell
<%= curl({
	:endpoint => "/bots",
	:method => "POST",
	:body => {
		:username => "mybot",
		:password => "mypass",
		:steamGuardCode => "ABC12"
	}
}) %>
```

```javascript
const bot = await daas.Bots.create({
	username: "mybot",
	password: "mypass",
	steamGuardCode: "ABC12"
})
```

> <%= http 201 %>

```json
<%= json({
	:id => 1,
	:username => "mybot",
	:password => "mypass",
	:steamGuardEnabled => true,
	:status => "OFFLINE",
	:disabledUntil => nil
}) %>
```

Adds a Steam account to be used as a lobby bot. Requires a valid
[Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/) account. The account will be verified
before creating the Bot.

<aside class="notice">
	<strong>Note:</strong> DaaS supports bots with Steam Guard. In fact, it is
	highly recommended to enable it in order to imporve their security.

### HTTP Request

`<%= post "/bots" %>`

### Body

Parameter | Type | Description
--------- | ---- | -----------
username | string | The username of your bot's Steam account.
password | string | The password of your bot's Steam account.
steamGuardCode | string? | If your bot has Steam Guard enabled, first attempt to create the bot with only the username and password. You will receive the `STEAM_GUARD_CODE_MISSING` error, and an email with the Steam Guard code will be sent to your bot's email account. Retrieve it and make the request again, this time passing the `steamGuardCode` parameter.

### Produces errors

Error | Scenario
----- | --------
STEAM_INVALID_LOGIN | If your `password` is incorrect.
STEAM_GUARD_CODE_MISSING | If your bot is protected by Steam Guard and you didn't pass a `steamGuardCode`.
STEAM_GUARD_CODE_INVALID | If you passed an invalid or expired `steamGuardCode`.
STEAM_UNKNOWN_ERROR | If Steam returns an unkown error (i.e: their login API is down).

## Update a Bot

Not currently implemented. Delete the bot and create it again instead.

## Delete a Bot

```shell
<%= curl({
	:endpoint => "/bots/:id",
	:method => "DELETE"
}) %>
```

```javascript
// With the bot object
await daas.Bots.delete(bot)

// With the bot id
await daas.Bots.delete(botId)
```

> <%= http 204 %>

Deletes a Bot, meaning that DaaS will not use it to host lobbies anymore.
However, if the bot is currently hosting a lobby, it will not be interrupted.

### HTTP Request

`<%= delete "/bots/:id" %>`

### URL Parameters

Parameter | Description
--------- | -----------
id | The ID of the Bot.
