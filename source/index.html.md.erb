# Introduction

This is a work in progress!

# Authentication

```shell
<%= curl({ :endpoint => "" }) %>
```

When you first run DaaS against an empty database, it will generate an API
Key with full privileges. You can access the DaaS API by passing the
`X-DaaS-Api-Key` HTTP header on each request.

<aside class="warning">
	<strong>Important!</strong> It is recommended that you generate a new API 
	Key with less privileges than the first one to use on your system's
	integration with DaaS. Typically, systems will only need <code>WRITE</code>
	privileges on <code>lobbies</code> and <code>READ</code> privileges on
	<code>webhooks</code> (more on that later).
